# WinForms Scheduler - Bind to a collection of custom appointments

This example shows how to bind the WinForms Scheduler control to a collection of business objects (`CustomAppointment`). The example creates two collections - one for appointments, another for resources. The appointment collection implements `IBindingList` (we recommend that you use the `System.ComponentModel.BindingList<T>`).

> **Note**
>
> Custom objects must implement certain properties to map to the corresponding scheduler appointment and resource properties.
